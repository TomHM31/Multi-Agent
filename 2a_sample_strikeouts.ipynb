The player\\'s last name. Case insensitive.\\n\\n`first:` String. Optional. The player\\'s first name. Case insensitive.\\n\\n`fuzzy:` Boolean. Optional. Search for inexact name matches, the 5 closest will be returned.\\n\\nProviding last name only will return all available id data for players with that last name (this will return several rows for a common last name like Jones, for example.) If multiple players exist for a (last name, first name) pair, you can figure out who\\'s who by seeing their first and last years of play in the fields `mlb_played_first` and `mlb_played_last`.\\n\\nThis data comes from Chadwick Bureau, meaning that there are several people in this data who are not MLB players. For this reason, supplying both last and first name is recommended to narrow your search. \\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import playerid_lookup\\n\\n# find the ids of all players with last name Jones (returns 1,314 rows)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\\'jones\\')\\n\\n# only return the ids of chipper jones (returns one row)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\\'jones\\',\\'chipper\\')\\n\\n# Will return all players named Pedro Martinez (returns *2* rows)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\"martinez\", \"pedro\", fuzzy=True)\\n\\n# Will return the 5 closest names to \"yadi molina\" (returns 5 rows)\\n# First row will be Yadier Molina\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\"molina\", \"yadi\", fuzzy=True)\\n```\\n\\n## List Lookup\\n\\n`player_search_list(player_list)`\\n\\nLook up a list of player ID\\'s by name, return a data frame of all players\\n\\n`player_list:` List.

The data returned for each pitch is explained on\\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team\\'s abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\\n\\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \\n\\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### A note on query time\\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \\n\\n### A note on parallelization\\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\\n\\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\\ndata = statcast(\\'2017-07-04\\')\\n\\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-08-01\\', \\'2016-08-07\\')\\n\\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-04-01\\', \\'2016-10-30\\', team=\\'TEX\\')\\n\\n# get data for yesterday\\ndata = statcast()```\\n\\n</statcast_documentation>Text between the <statcast_dictionary></statcast_dictionary> tags is the data dictionary for the statcast function.\\n<statcast_dictionary>\\n\\npitch_type\\nThe type of pitch derived from Statcast.\\n\\ngame_date\\nDate of the Game.\\n\\nrelease_speed\\nPitch velocities from 2008-16 are via Pitch F/X, and adjusted to roughly out-of-hand release point.
