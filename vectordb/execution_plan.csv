How many games did the Rays win in 2022?,"
1. Import the schedule_and_record function from the pybaseball library:

from pybaseball import schedule_and_record

2. Call the schedule_and_record function with the season (2022) and team ('TB' for Tampa Bay Rays):

rays_2022 = schedule_and_record(2022, 'TB')

3. To get the number of wins, filter the dataframe to rows where the 'W/L' column equals 'W' (for wins) or 'W-wo' (for walk-off wins):

wins = rays_2022[(rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W') | (rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W-wo')]

4. Get the count of rows in the filtered dataframe to get the total number of wins (including walk-offs):

num_wins = len(wins)

5. Print out the number of wins:

print(f""The Tampa Bay Rays won {num_wins} games in the 2022 season (including walk-offs)."")
