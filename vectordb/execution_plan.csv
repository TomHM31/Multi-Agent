How many games did the Rays win in 2022?," Here is an updated plan for determining how many games the Rays won in 2022 using pybaseball:

1. Use the schedule_and_record() function to get the Rays' 2022 season schedule and results. Pass in 2022 for the season and ""TBR"" for the Rays team abbreviation.

2. From the schedule_and_record output, filter the dataframe to only include rows where the Home_Away column equals 'Home' or '@'. This will remove extraneous rows and correctly identify away games. 

3. Create a new column in the filtered dataframe called 'Rays Win' that indicates whether the Rays won each game. Set to 1 if the W/L column equals 'W' or 'W-wo' for a Rays win, and 0 if W/L equals 'L' for a Rays loss.

4. Sum the Rays Win column to get the total number of Rays wins for the season, including walk-off wins.

How many games did the Braves win in 2022?," Here is the original plan without modifications:

Here is an updated plan for determining how many games the Braves won in 2022 using pybaseball: 

1. Use the schedule_and_record() function to get the Braves' 2022 season schedule and results. Pass in 2022 for the season and ""ATL"" for the Braves team abbreviation.

2. From the schedule_and_record output, filter the dataframe to only include rows where the Home_Away column equals 'Home' or '@'. This will remove extraneous rows and correctly identify away games.

3. Create a new column in the filtered dataframe called 'Braves Win' that indicates whether the Braves won each game. Set to 1 if the W/L column equals 'W' or 'W-wo' for a Braves win, and 0 if W/L equals 'L' for a Braves loss.

4. Sum the 'Braves Win' column to get the total number of Braves wins for the season, including walk-off wins.
