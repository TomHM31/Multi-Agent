How many games did the Rays win in 2010?,"Step 1: Import the pybaseball library and the schedule_and_record function.

import pybaseball
from pybaseball import schedule_and_record  

Step 2: Call the schedule_and_record function to get the 2010 Rays game results.

rays_2010 = schedule_and_record(2010, 'TB')

Step 3: Filter the dataframe to include games where the Rays won (W) or had a walk-off win (W-wo).  

rays_wins = rays_2010[rays_2010['W/L'].isin(['W', 'W-wo'])]

total_wins = len(rays_wins)  

Step 5: Print out the total wins for the 2010 Rays season including walk-offs.
