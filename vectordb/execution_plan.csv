How many games did the Rays win in 2022?,"1. Import the schedule_and_record function from pybaseball:

```python
from pybaseball import schedule_and_record
```

2. Get the 2022 schedule and results for the Tampa Bay Rays:

```python
rays_2022 = schedule_and_record(2022, 'TB')
```

3. Filter the dataframe to games where the Rays won (W/L == 'W') or had a walk-off win (W/L == 'W-wo'):

```python
rays_wins = rays_2022[(rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W') | (rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W-wo')]
```

4. Count the number of rows (games won) in the filtered dataframe:

```python
num_wins = len(rays_wins)
print(f""The Tampa Bay Rays won {num_wins} games in 2022."")
```","# 1. Import the schedule_and_record function from pybaseball

How many home runs did Derek Jeter hit in 2008?,"Here is the updated plan with the code used:

1. Import the statcast_batter and playerid_lookup functions from pybaseball:

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_batter, playerid_lookup
```

2. Look up Derek Jeter's MLBAM player ID using fuzzy matching:

```python 
jeter_id = playerid_lookup('jeter', 'derek', fuzzy=True)
jeter_mlbam_id = jeter_id['key_mlbam'][0]  
```

3. Get Derek Jeter's statcast batting data for the 2008 season:

```python
jeter_2008_data = statcast_batter('2008-01-01', '2008-12-31', player_id=jeter_mlbam_id)
```

4. Filter to only pitches that resulted in home runs and count the number of rows:

```python
# Filter to only pitches that resulted in home runs
jeter_2008_hr = jeter_2008_data[jeter_2008_data['events'] == 'home_run']

# Count the number of home runs
hr_count = len(jeter_2008_hr) 

# Print the result
print(f""Derek Jeter hit {hr_count} home runs in the 2008 season."")

How many doubles did Whit Merrifield hit in 2019?,"1. Import the statcast_batter and playerid_lookup functions from pybaseball:

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_batter, playerid_lookup
```

2. Look up Whit Merrifield's MLBAM player ID using fuzzy matching:

```python
merrifield_id = playerid_lookup('merrifield', 'whit', fuzzy=True)
merrifield_mlbam_id = merrifield_id['key_mlbam'][0]
```

3. Get Whit Merrifield's statcast batting data for the 2019 season:

```python
merrifield_2019_data = statcast_batter('2019-01-01', '2019-12-31', player_id=merrifield_mlbam_id)
```

4. Filter to only pitches that resulted in doubles and count the number:

```python
