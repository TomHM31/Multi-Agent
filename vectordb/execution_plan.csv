How many games did the Rays win in 2022?,"Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from pybaseball import schedule_and_record

Step 2: Use the schedule_and_record function to retrieve the Rays' 2022 game results
rays_2022 = schedule_and_record(2022, 'TB')

Step 3: Count the number of regular wins  
num_regular_wins = len(rays_2022[rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W'])

Step 4: Count the number of walk-off wins
num_walkoff_wins = len(rays_2022[rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W-wo'])  

Step 5: Calculate the total number of wins
num_total_wins = num_regular_wins + num_walkoff_wins
