Plot the cumulative sum of strikeouts thrown by Danny Duffy in the 2018 season.,"
1. Use `playerid_lookup` to get Danny Duffy's MLBAM player ID:

```python
from pybaseball import playerid_lookup

duffy_id = playerid_lookup('duffy', 'danny')['key_mlbam'].values[0]
```

2. Use `statcast_pitcher` to retrieve Danny Duffy's pitch-level data for the 2018 season:

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_pitcher 

duffy_2018 = statcast_pitcher('2018-03-01', '2018-10-31', player_id=duffy_id)
```

3. Filter the data to only include strikeouts, using a case-insensitive search:

```python
strikeouts = duffy_2018.loc[duffy_2018['events'].str.lower() == 'strikeout']
```

4. Count the number of strikeouts for each game date:

```python
strikeouts_by_date = strikeouts.groupby('game_date').size().reset_index()
strikeouts_by_date.columns = ['game_date', 'strikeouts']
```

5. Sort the data by game date:

```python
strikeouts_by_date = strikeouts_by_date.sort_values('game_date')
```

6. Calculate the cumulative sum of strikeouts:

```python
strikeouts_by_date['cum_strikeouts'] = strikeouts_by_date['strikeouts'].cumsum()
```

7. Plot the cumulative sum over time:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(strikeouts_by_date['game_date'], strikeouts_by_date['cum_strikeouts'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Strikeouts')
plt.title('Danny Duffy 2018 Cumulative Strikeouts')
plt.show()
```

plot the cumulative sum of total walks thrown by Shane Bieber in the 2020 season.,"

1. Use `playerid_lookup` to get Shane Bieber's MLBAM player ID:

```python
from pybaseball import playerid_lookup

bieber_id = playerid_lookup('bieber', 'shane')['key_mlbam'].values[0]
```

2. Use `statcast_pitcher` to retrieve Shane Bieber's pitch-level data for the 2020 season:

```python
from pybaseball import statcast_pitcher 

bieber_2020 = statcast_pitcher('2020-03-01', '2020-10-31', player_id=bieber_id)
```

3. Filter the data to only include walks, using a case-insensitive search:

```python
walks = bieber_2020.loc[bieber_2020['events'].str.lower() == 'walk']
```

4. Count the number of walks for each game date:

```python
walks_by_date = walks.groupby('game_date').size().reset_index()
walks_by_date.columns = ['game_date', 'walks']
```

5. Sort the data by game date:

```python
walks_by_date = walks_by_date.sort_values('game_date')
```

6. Calculate the cumulative sum of walks:

```python
walks_by_date['cum_walks'] = walks_by_date['walks'].cumsum()
```

7. Plot the cumulative sum over time with only 5 labels on the x-axis:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(walks_by_date['game_date'], walks_by_date['cum_walks'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Walks')
plt.title('Shane Bieber 2020 Cumulative Walks')
plt.xticks(walks_by_date['game_date'][::len(walks_by_date)//5])
plt.show()
