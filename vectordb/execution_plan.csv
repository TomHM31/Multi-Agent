How many games did the Rays win in 2022?,"Based on the feedback, it's clear that the original plan needs to be adjusted to account for walk-off wins, which are labeled as 'W-wo' in the 'W/L' column. Here's the revised plan:

Updated Plan:

1. Use the `schedule_and_record` function from the pybaseball library.
2. Pass in the following attributes:
   - season: 2022
   - team: ""TBR"" (abbreviation for the Tampa Bay Rays)
3. Retrieve the output dataframe from the function.
4. Extract the ""W/L"" column from the dataframe, which indicates whether the Rays won or lost each game.
5. Modify the counting method to include both ""W"" (indicating a win) and ""W-wo"" (indicating a walk-off win) values in the ""W/L"" column.
6. To achieve this, you can use a condition that checks for both ""W"" and ""W-wo"" when counting the total number of wins.
7. The count obtained in step 6 represents the total number of games the Rays won in the 2022 season, including regular wins and walk-off wins.

This adjustment ensures that all types of wins are accurately counted, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the team's performance in the season.

Consider the first week of August 2020 - find 3 pitchers who's curveballs were most similar to Max Scherzer's.,"Based on the feedback provided, here is the revised plan that incorporates the suggested steps of creating an average vector for each pitcher's curveball, training a KNN model, and using this model to find the 3 pitchers with the most similar curveball to Max Scherzer's, excluding Scherzer himself:

1. Use the `playerid_lookup` function from the pybaseball library to find Max Scherzer's MLBAM player ID.
   - Pass in ""Scherzer"" as the last name and ""Max"" as the first name.
   
2. Use the `statcast_pitcher` function to retrieve Max Scherzer's pitching data.
   - Pass in the appropriate date range and Max Scherzer's MLBAM player ID.
   
3. Filter the retrieved data to only include curveballs thrown by Max Scherzer.
   - Use the `pitch_type` field to filter for curveballs.
   
4. Calculate the average vector for Max Scherzer's curveballs using relevant fields such as `release_speed`, `release_spin`, and `release_extension`.

5. Retrieve a comprehensive dataset of pitchers and their pitches within the same timeframe as Max Scherzer's data.
   - Use the `statcast` function with the same date range as used for Scherzer but without specifying a player ID.
   
6. Filter this dataset to only include curveballs.
   - Again, use the `pitch_type` field to filter for curveballs.
   
7. Group the data by pitcher and calculate the average vector for each pitcher's curveballs using the same fields as for Scherzer.

8. Train a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) model on this dataset of average vectors for each pitcher.
   - Exclude Max Scherzer's data from the training set.
   
9. Use the trained KNN model to find the 3 pitchers with the most similar curveball to Max Scherzer's based on the average vector calculated in step 4.
   - Input Max Scherzer's average curveball vector into the model to find the nearest neighbors.

10. Present the findings, including the names and IDs of the 3 pitchers with the most similar curveballs to Max Scherzer's.

This plan follows a data-driven approach to identify pitchers with similar curveballs to Max Scherzer by leveraging machine learning (specifically, KNN) for comparison. It ensures that the analysis is comprehensive and objective by using quantifiable metrics for comparison.
