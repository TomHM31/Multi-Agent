How many games did the Rays win in 2022?,"1. Import the schedule_and_record function from pybaseball:

```python
from pybaseball import schedule_and_record
```

2. Get the 2022 schedule and results for the Tampa Bay Rays:

```python
rays_2022 = schedule_and_record(2022, 'TB')
```

3. Filter the dataframe to games where the Rays won (W/L == 'W') or had a walk-off win (W/L == 'W-wo'):

```python
rays_wins = rays_2022[(rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W') | (rays_2022['W/L'] == 'W-wo')]
```

4. Count the number of rows (games won) in the filtered dataframe:

```python
num_wins = len(rays_wins)
print(f""The Tampa Bay Rays won {num_wins} games in 2022."")
```","# 1. Import the schedule_and_record function from pybaseball
