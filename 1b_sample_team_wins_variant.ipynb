Use the `schedule_and_record` function from the pybaseball library to retrieve the game-level results for the Atlanta Braves for the 2022 season. To do this, pass in two specific attributes to the function:\\n   - `season`: Set this to `2022` to specify the year you are interested in.\\n   - `team`: Use the abbreviation for the Atlanta Braves, which is `\"ATL\"`. This is crucial as using the wrong abbreviation or a full team name will result in an unsuccessful query.\\n\\n2. Once you have the data, focus on the \"W/L\" column of the returned dataframe. This column indicates whether the Braves won or lost each game.\\n\\n3. To count the number of games won by the Braves in 2022, filter the dataframe for rows where the \"W/L\" column has a value of \"W\" or \"W-wo\". \"W\" stands for a regular win, while \"W-wo\" stands for a walk-off win.\\n\\n4. After filtering, count the number of rows in the filtered dataframe.
