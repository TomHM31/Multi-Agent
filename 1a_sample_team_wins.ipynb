The abbreviation of the team for which you are requesting data (e.g. \"PHI\", \"BOS\", \"LAD\"). \\n\\nNote that if a team did not exist during the year you are requesting data for, the query will be unsuccessful. Historical name and city changes for teams in older seasons can cause some problems as well. The Los Angeles Dodgers (\"LAD\"), for example, are abbreviated \"BRO\" in older seasons, due to their origins as the Brooklyn Dodgers.
