If the season is incomplete, it will provide scheduling information for future games. \\n\\n## Arguments\\n`season:` Integer. The season for which you want a team\\'s record data. \\n\\n`team:` String. The abbreviation of the team for which you are requesting data (e.g. \"PHI\", \"BOS\", \"LAD\"). \\n\\nNote that if a team did not exist during the year you are requesting data for, the query will be unsuccessful. Historical name and city changes for teams in older seasons can cause some problems as well. The Los Angeles Dodgers (\"LAD\"), for example, are abbreviated \"BRO\" in older seasons, due to their origins as the Brooklyn Dodgers. This may at times require some detective work in certain cases.   \\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import schedule_and_record\\n\\n# Game-by-game results from the Yankees\\' 1927 season\\ndata = schedule_and_record(1927, \"NYY\")\\n\\n# Results and upcoming schedule for the Phillies\\' current season (2017 at the time of writing)\\ndata = schedule_and_record(2017, \"PHI\")\\n```\\n\\nHere is the data dictionary for function schedule_and_record:\\nDate: date the game was played\\nTm: team\\nHome_Away: indicator of Home (Home) or Away (@) game\\nOpp: opponenet\\nW/L: Win or Loss indicator\\nR: runs scored\\nRA: runs allowed\\nInn: innings played\\nW-L: team\\'s win-loss record after the game end\\nRank: team\\'s ranking in the division\\nGB: how many games back (or up) the team is in the divion\\nWin: winning pitcher\\nLoss: losing pitcher\\nSave: saving pitcher\\nTime: game duration\\nD/N: day or night game indicator\\nAttendance: game attendance\\ncLI: Championship Leverage Index. This is a statistic that measures the importance of winning a game to a team\\'s chances of winning the World Series.\\nStreak: how many consecutive wins or losses for the team.
