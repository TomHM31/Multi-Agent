Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`player_id:` MLBAM player ID for the player you want to retrieve data for. To find a player\\'s MLBAM ID, see the function [playerid_lookup](http://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/docs/playerid_lookup.md) or the examples below. \\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast_batter\\nfrom pybaseball import playerid_lookup\\n\\n# find David Ortiz\\'s player id (mlbam_key)\\nplayerid_lookup(\\'ortiz\\',\\'david\\')\\n\\n# get all available data\\ndata = statcast_batter(\\'2008-04-01\\', \\'2017-07-15\\', player_id = 120074)\\n\\n# get data for August 16th, 2014\\ndata = statcast_batter(\\'2014-08-16\\', player_id = 120074)\\n```\\n\\n</statcast_batter_documentation>\\nText between the <playerid_lookup_documentation></playerid_lookup_documentation> tags is documentation for the playerid_lookup library.  Consult this section to confirm which attributes to pass into the playerid_lookup library.\\n<playerid_lookup_documentation>\\n# Player ID Lookup\\n\\n## Single Player Lookup\\n\\n`playerid_lookup(last, first=None, fuzzy=False)`\\n\\nLook up a player\\'s MLBAM, Retrosheet, FanGraphs, and Baseball Reference ID by name.\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`last:` String. The player\\'s last name. Case insensitive.\\n\\n`first:` String. Optional. The player\\'s first name. Case insensitive.\\n\\n`fuzzy:` Boolean. Optional. Search for inexact name matches, the 5 closest will be returned.\\n\\nProviding last name only will return all available id data for players with that last name (this will return several rows for a common last name like Jones, for example.) If multiple players exist for a (last name, first name) pair, you can figure out who\\'s who by seeing their first and last years of play in the fields `mlb_played_first` and `mlb_played_last`.\\n\\nThis data comes from Chadwick Bureau, meaning that there are several people in this data who are not MLB players. For this reason, supplying both last and first name is recommended to narrow your search. \\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import playerid_lookup\\n\\n# find the ids of all players with last name Jones (returns 1,314 rows)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\\'jones\\')\\n\\n# only return the ids of chipper jones (returns one row)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\\'jones\\',\\'chipper\\')\\n\\n# Will return all players named Pedro Martinez (returns *2* rows)\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\"martinez\", \"pedro\", fuzzy=True)\\n\\n# Will return the 5 closest names to \"yadi molina\" (returns 5 rows)\\n# First row will be Yadier Molina\\ndata = playerid_lookup(\"molina\", \"yadi\", fuzzy=True)\\n```\\n\\n## List Lookup\\n\\n`player_search_list(player_list)`\\n\\nLook up a list of player ID\\'s by name, return a data frame of all players\\n\\n`player_list:` List. A list of tuples, of the form `(last, first)`. Case Insensitive.\\n\\nSources are the same as those used in the above `playerid_lookup` function. Queries for this function must be exact name matches.\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\n\\nfrom pybaseball import player_search_list\\n\\n# Will return the ids for both Lou Brock and Chipper Jones (returns 2 rows)\\ndata = player_search_list([(\"brock\",\"lou\"), (\"jones\",\"chipper\")])\\n\\n```\\n</playerid_lookup_documentation>\\n'}}\n",
