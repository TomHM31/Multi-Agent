The data returned for each pitch is explained on\\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team\\'s abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\\n\\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \\n\\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### A note on query time\\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \\n\\n### A note on parallelization\\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\\n\\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\\ndata = statcast(\\'2017-07-04\\')\\n\\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-08-01\\', \\'2016-08-07\\')\\n\\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-04-01\\', \\'2016-10-30\\', team=\\'TEX\\')\\n\\n# get data for yesterday\\ndata = statcast()```\\n\\n</statcast_documentation>\\nText between the <statcast_pitcher_documentation></statcast_pitcher_documentation> tags is documentation for the statcast_pitcher library.

If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`player_id:` MLBAM player ID for the pitcher you want to retrieve data for. To find a player\\'s MLBAM ID, see the function [playerid_lookup](http://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/docs/playerid_lookup.md) or the examples below. \\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### Known issue\\nIn rare cases where a player has seen greater than 30,000 pitches over the time period specified in your query, only the first 30,000 of these plays will be returned. There is a fix in the works for this\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast_pitcher\\nfrom pybaseball import playerid_lookup\\n\\n# find Chris Sale\\'s player id (mlbam_key)\\nplayerid_lookup(\\'sale\\',\\'chris\\')\\n\\n# get all available data\\ndata = statcast_pitcher(\\'2008-04-01\\', \\'2017-07-15\\', player_id = 519242)\\n\\n# get data for July 15th, 2017\\ndata = statcast_pitcher(\\'2017-07-15\\',\\'2017-07-15\\', player_id = 519242)\\n```\\n</statcast_pitcher_documentation>\\nText between the <playerid_lookup_documentation></playerid_lookup_documentation> tags is documentation for the playerid_lookup library.

The data returned for each pitch is explained on\\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team\\'s abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\\n\\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \\n\\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### A note on query time\\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \\n\\n### A note on parallelization\\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\\n\\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\\ndata = statcast(\\'2017-07-04\\')\\n\\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-08-01\\', \\'2016-08-07\\')\\n\\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-04-01\\', \\'2016-10-30\\', team=\\'TEX\\')\\n\\n# get data for yesterday\\ndata = statcast()```\\n\\n</statcast_documentation>\\nText between the <statcast_pitcher_documentation></statcast_pitcher_documentation> tags is documentation for the statcast_pitcher library.

To find a player\\'s MLBAM ID, see the function [playerid_lookup](http://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball/docs/playerid_lookup.md) or the examples below. \\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### Known issue\\nIn rare cases where a player has seen greater than 30,000 pitches over the time period specified in your query, only the first 30,000 of these plays will be returned.

The data returned for each pitch is explained on\\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team\\'s abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\\n\\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \\n\\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### A note on query time\\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \\n\\n### A note on parallelization\\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\\n\\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\\ndata = statcast(\\'2017-07-04\\')\\n\\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-08-01\\', \\'2016-08-07\\')\\n\\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-04-01\\', \\'2016-10-30\\', team=\\'TEX\\')\\n\\n# get data for yesterday\\ndata = statcast()```\\n\\n</statcast_documentation>\\nText between the <statcast_pitcher_documentation></statcast_pitcher_documentation> tags is documentation for the statcast_pitcher library.

The data returned for each pitch is explained on\\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\\n\\n## Arguments\\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday\\'s date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \\n\\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team\\'s abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\\n\\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \\n\\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\\n\\n### A note on data availability \\nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \\n\\n### A note on query time\\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \\n\\n### A note on parallelization\\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\\n\\n## Examples of valid queries\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\\n\\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\\ndata = statcast(\\'2017-07-04\\')\\n\\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-08-01\\', \\'2016-08-07\\')\\n\\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\\ndata = statcast(\\'2016-04-01\\', \\'2016-10-30\\', team=\\'TEX\\')\\n\\n# get data for yesterday\\ndata = statcast()```\\n\\n</statcast_documentation>\\nText between the <statcast_pitcher_documentation></statcast_pitcher_documentation> tags is documentation for the statcast_pitcher library.
